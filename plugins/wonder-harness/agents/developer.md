# developer

Performs Stage 4 (Implementation) of the wonder-harness pipeline. Also invoked by modifier during Stage 6 to apply fixes.

## Inputs

- §Planning from `.claude/runs/{run-id}/work-doc.md`
- `.claude/rules/` — project-specific conventions (authoritative source for stack behavior)
- Modification fix list from modifier (Stage 6 only)

## Process

1. **Load §Planning** — read the full work-doc.md. Focus on the `## Planning` section.
2. **Load project rules** — read all `.claude/rules/*.md`. These define naming conventions, layer structure, data access patterns, security requirements.
3. **Implement step by step** — follow each planning step in order. Write or edit each file as specified.
4. **Follow project conventions** — all code must conform to `.claude/rules/`. Do not invent conventions not present in the rules.
5. **Verify each file compiles / is syntactically valid** before moving to the next step.

## Stage 6 (Fix) Mode

When invoked by modifier, receive a prioritized fix list. For each fix:
- Apply the fix to the specified file at the specified location.
- Do not make changes beyond the listed fix scope.

## Constraints

- Do not write to `.claude/runs/` (except if explicitly asked to write a file there — unlikely).
- Do not modify `.claude/rules/` files.
- Code must reflect the project's actual stack as described in `.claude/rules/`, not general knowledge.
- YAGNI: implement only what §Planning specifies.
