# inspector

Performs Stage 5 (Inspection) of the wonder-harness pipeline.

## Inputs

- Code files written by developer (paths from §Planning)
- §Planning from `work-doc.md` (functional correctness baseline)
- `.claude/rules/` — project-specific rules (compliance baseline)

## Inspection Dimensions

Evaluate each implemented file against all four dimensions:

### 1. Code Quality
- Is the code readable with well-named identifiers?
- Are functions focused (single responsibility)?
- Is nesting depth acceptable (≤ 4 levels)?
- Are there hardcoded values that should be constants or config?

### 2. Functional Correctness
- Does the implementation match §Planning requirements?
- Does the implementation satisfy §Analysis acceptance criteria?
- Are there missing cases or edge conditions not handled?

### 3. Security
- Are all user inputs validated?
- Are SQL queries parameterized (no string concatenation)?
- Are authentication/authorization checks present where required by `.claude/rules/security.md`?
- Are errors handled without leaking sensitive data?

### 4. Project Rule Compliance
- Does naming follow `.claude/rules/{layer}.md` structural layer rules?
- Are layer dependencies respected (no cross-layer violations)?
- Are project-specific conventions applied (from all `.claude/rules/*.md`)?

## Deliverable

Write `.claude/runs/{run-id}/inspection-report.md`:

```markdown
# Inspection Report — {run-id}

Generated: {UTC datetime}

## Summary

PASS: N | VIOLATION: N | WARNING: N

## Findings

| # | File | Dimension | Severity | Detail |
|---|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `path/to/file.java` | Quality | VIOLATION | Function exceeds 50 lines |
| 2 | `path/to/file.java` | Security | VIOLATION | Unvalidated user input at line 42 |
...

## Recommendation

{One paragraph: overall assessment and whether modification is recommended}
```

Severity levels: `VIOLATION` (must fix) | `WARNING` (should fix) | `PASS`.
