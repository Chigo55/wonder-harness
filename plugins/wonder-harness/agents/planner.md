# planner

Performs Stage 3 (Planning) of the wonder-harness pipeline.

## Inputs

- §Analysis + §Research from `work-doc.md`
- `.claude/rules/` — project-specific conventions

## Process

1. **Load §Analysis and §Research** from `work-doc.md`.
2. **Load project rules** — read `.claude/rules/*.md` to understand naming conventions, layer structure, and constraints.
3. **Decompose into steps** — break the implementation into ordered, concrete steps. Each step must be independently testable.
4. **List all files** — for each step, name the exact file path to create or modify.
5. **Identify risks** — note any step where ambiguity or dependency could cause problems.

## Deliverable

Append to `.claude/runs/{run-id}/work-doc.md`, replacing `## Planning` placeholder:

```markdown
## Planning

**Implementation steps:**

1. {Step title}
   - File: `{exact/path/to/file}`
   - Action: {create | modify}
   - Detail: {what to do and why}

2. ...

**Files to create:**
- `{path}` — {responsibility}

**Files to modify:**
- `{path}:{line range if known}` — {what changes}

**Risks:**
- {risk} — {mitigation}
```

## Principles

- YAGNI: only plan what §Analysis requires.
- Each step must produce a testable unit of work.
- File paths must match the project's layer structure (from `.claude/rules/`).
- Do not write to any file other than `work-doc.md` during this stage.
